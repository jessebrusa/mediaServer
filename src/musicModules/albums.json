    "bio": "The Carpenters was an American vocal and instrumental duo consisting of siblings Karen and Richard Carpenter. With their light, airy melodies and meticulously crafted, clean arrangements, the duo stood in direct contrast with the excessive, gaudy pop/rock of the '70s; yet they became one of the most popular artists of the decade, scoring 12 Top Ten hits, including three number one singles. \n\nKaren Carpenter's calm, often somber voice was the most distinctive element of their music <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carpenters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>"
